# tictactoe-cpp
A simple tictactoe game in cpp.

The game is divided into 3 source files, 
  1. main.cpp : Nothing much, just creates an instance of handler class and runs it.
  2. handler.cpp : It uses header file handler.h to create an object board using board.h to create the game board and uses some other functions
                   to interact with user and run the game.
  3. board.cpp : It uses header file board.h to create a game board using 2-D vector. we can create a board of N*N size and set number of 
                 markers required.
